# Space-Shooter-ML
Implemented Unity ML Agents Toolkit on a cut down version of Space Shooter. Removed enemy lasers, power ups and player wrapping. Taught the AI to play the game with 1000+ hours of game experience using Reinforcement Learning. Used 2D ray perception sensors, heuristics and a Reward/Punishment System.
